What the hell happened here? ; In this implementation each cell will have eight bytes (64 bit) assigned to it.
What the hell happened here? ; The code input and cells will be stored on the stack, as to avoid indirect addressing and
What the hell happened here? ; memory as this isn't provided in MemeASM at this point in time. Other fun limitations
What the hell happened here? ; include the fact that comparison labels can be only used once globally.
What the hell happened here? ;
What the hell happened here? ; Therefore this code is an abomination, please don't look to closely at it. It is very
What the hell happened here? ; shy and may run away or segfault into oblivion. But Hello World should run.
